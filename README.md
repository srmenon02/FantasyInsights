# üî• FantasyInsights

A data science project that classifies fantasy football players into meaningful **performance archetypes** based on weekly consistency, volatility, and scoring trends. Instead of just ranking players by total points, this tool helps fantasy managers understand *how* players score ‚Äî whether they‚Äôre steady contributors, boom-or-bust wildcards, or trap picks with high usage but poor results.

## üöÄ Features

- Clusters players into performance archetypes using machine learning
- Analyzes volatility, ceiling, floor, and usage patterns
- Generates consistent metrics like:
  - Average Fantasy Points
  - Standard Deviation (Volatility)
  - Boom Rate
  - Bust Rate
  - Consistency Score
- Optional Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration

## üõ† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Weekly player performance is collected from fantasy football APIs or CSVs.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Key metrics like boom/bust rate, floor/ceiling, and usage trends are extracted.

3. **Clustering**  
   Players are grouped using K-Means to identify behavior-based archetypes.

4. **Visualization**  
   Outputs include scatter plots, cluster summaries, and optional web dashboards.

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FantasyInsights.git
   cd FantasyInsights
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
3. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the clustering pipeline:
